### Roman to Decimal and Back:
  A Python script that converts between Roman and Decimal numbers, with a value of less then 3,999. Written in Python3  
Time to Code: 2.5 hrs  
### Instructions:  
<ol>
<li>DOWNLOAD file to a system that has Python3 installed</li>
<li>RUN it on either on your IDE of choice or run "python3 roman.py" from the command line</li>
<li>FOLLOW instructions you see in your console, type in the number you want converted and hit enter</li>
</ol>  

### Considerations:  
  * If a decimal number is entered that is larger than 3,999 is entered it prompts for a new number
  * If a not valid character is included or a mix of decimal and roman is entered it prompts for a new number
  * If a space is included in the number it prompts for a new number
  * If a improper Roman numeral is entered it prompts for a new number

### Future Steps:
  I would take a look at condensing the function decToRoman() since it has a lot of repeated code.
